- soundcloud api access to dropbox?
- streaming with soundcloud?
- still working on splitter on separate branch
- compile custom libsox (mad, flac, ogg vorbis only) with dynamic linking so i'm not redistributing gpl code - not gonna worry about this. sox is lgpl and i am not redistributing any of its other libs anyway
- sox can't always give me requested sample rate or channel number. need to handle this gracefully. and convert. options. solution: convert all files to desired layout and sample rate with afconvert first - need automated afconvert. this will be in the soundcloud handler and google voice handler, i guess
- handlers, in order: (ha, guess i fucked that up)
* soundcloud uploader + streaming (listen page + m3u)
* web voting - sort of
* UI - good shape for now
* google voice downloader
* twitter announcements :) :) :) :)
* soundcloud downloader
- fs1rgen working, or at least patch selection and output recording
- double check to make sure all correct license advertising clauses are present, make sure i am using a compatible license. might need to be gpl :(
- make sure ga's terminator is NEVER
- install pygooglevoice, soundcloud c api wrapper, curl,  on kiosk
- can i figure out a way to bounce compositions in a separate thread to avoid UI lockups?
- can i figure out a way to allow people to pop in CDs or attach usb drives? SAFELY. deprioritize this
- add beteckna to contrib
