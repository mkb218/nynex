- twitter account for announcements - done!
- streaming with soundcloud?
- get sound file bits working - almost done!
- compile custom libsox (mad, flac, ogg vorbis only) with dynamic linking so i'm not redistributing gpl code - not gonna worry about this. sox is lgpl and i am not redistributing any of its other libs anyway
- add sox libs to other projects web page - done!
- add unlockedgroove to contributors page and add three releases to inputs - done!
- figure out what the heck is going on with memory - done!
- sox can't always give me requested sample rate or channel number. need to handle this gracefully. and convert. options. solution: convert all files to desired layout and sample rate with afconvert first - need automated afconvert. this will be in the soundcloud handler
- samplebank needs a tmp dir - done!
- sample::splitfile needs a maxbufcount. once the length of the buffer list reaches maxbufcount, buffers get saved to disk. need a class to do this and encapsulate a sox_sample_t. - done!
- handlers, in order:
* soundcloud uploader
* soundcloud streaming
* web voting
* UI
* google voice downloader
* twitter announcements
- fs1rgen working, or at least patch selection and output recording
- double check to make sure all correct license advertising clauses are present
- make sure i am using a compatible license. might need to be gpl :(
