	<p>The Republic of Nynex was created in response to a call for submissions to the 2010 <a href="http://megapolisfestival.org/">Megapolis Festival</a> in Baltimore. The name derives from NYNEX, the company formed by the merger of Baby Bells New England Telephone and New York Telephone. The Republic of Nynex as a fictional state could be thought of as the northern segment of the independent BosWash in some dystopian post-US future. Or, it could be something else.</p>
