		<div id="pagetitle">About the Republic of Nynex.</div>
		<div id="pagesubtitle">The Republic of Nynex is an audio art installation that uses genetic programming to create audio compositions using audience-submitted raw audio and a Yamaha FS1r synthesizer.</div>
		<div id="content">
			<p>The Republic of Nynex was created in response to a call for submissions to the 2010 <a href="http://megapolisfestival.org/">Megapolis Festival</a> in Baltimore. The name derives from NYNEX, the company formed by the merger of Baby Bells New England Telephone and New York Telephone. The Republic of Nynex as a fictional state could be thought of as the northern segment of the independent BosWash in some dystopian post-US future. Or, it could be something else.</p>
			<p>The Republic of Nynex is written primarily in C++, taking advantage of numerous open source projects and web services</p>
			<p><a href="http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/">GALib</a> is an MIT-funded project implementing genetic algorithms, allowing developers to take advantage of genetic programming research without starting from scratch.</p>
			<p><a href="http://hydrogenproject.com/pages/fs1rgen.html">FS1rgen</a> is another GAlib project now contained within the Republic of Nynex.</p>
			<p><a href="http://openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a> is a set of cross-platform libraries used to make audiovisual interfaces extremely easy.</p>
			<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pygooglevoice/">PyGoogleVoice</a> allows programmatic access to Google Voice.</p>
			<p><a href="http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net">RapidXML</a> is a very lightweight DOM XML parser used by fs1rgen to parse the XML file describing the data layout of the Yamaha FS1r.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. They emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Republic of Nynex uses Boost's math libraries statistical functions, along with the Any, Foreach, and Ref libraries.</p>
			<p><a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/libsox.html">libsox</a> is a library of sound sample file format readers/writers and sound effects processors. It is mainly developed for use by SoX but is useful for any sound application.</p>
			<p><a href="http://blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> is a lightweight, extremely customizable blog engine.</p>
			<p>From here, you can <a href="http://github.com/mkb218/nynex/">follow the software's development</a>, <a href="blosxom.cgi">read the progress blog</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Republic-of-Nynex/268718961023">become a Facebook fan</a>, or <a href="contrib.html">see information on audio contributors</a>. Soon, you will be able contribute your own audio recordings, listen to new compositions and rate them, listen to previous generations of compositions, read on the Republic of Nynex's creator, read more detailed information about the project, and read where in-person demonstrations will be occurring.</p></div>
