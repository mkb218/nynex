Ready for Megapolis
I have completed the final install of the Nynex software and all dependencies on the kiosk machine. Although the software has its flaws, I won't be making any more changes until festival time! I've received a request regarding another live outing of the project in a performance context, but for the moment all focus is on MEGAPOLIS! Baltimore, look out!
