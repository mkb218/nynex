# The blok plugin intercepts the "story" subroutine and 
# converts Mac (ascii 13) or Windows (ascii 10,13) line-ends 
# to the "newline" (ascii 10) that blosxom expects.

# This enables you to stop thinking about the line-end 
# format in your word processor, and whether your ftp 
# app is set to convert your native line-ends to *nixies. 
# (Also helpful for processing writebacks.)

# You want this to load early, so be prepared to prepend "00" 
# to the plugin's file name. See Blosxom documentation for 
# full details on setting plugin load order.

# Blosxom expects \n line endings (ascii 10), but macs might use 
# \r (ascii 13), and windows might use \r\n (ascii 13,10); we'll 
# just clean that up...
